## Problem Statement

In this project, we try to analyze the StackOverflow developer survey dataset. The dataset contains responses to an annual survey conducted by StackOverflow. You can find the raw data & official analysis [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

It would be interesting to know about ...
- Countries of developers and how they are distributed.
- The sexual orinetation and level of education that the developers have. 
- What kind of languages are most popular in he world today. 

## Dataset Used

The dataset has been downloaded from `opendatasets` which is an open source python library. From there we have downloaded two files in `csv` format. 

## Tech Stack

We have used python language for our project and have done it in a jupyter notebook. The libraries that we have used are `opendatasets`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
